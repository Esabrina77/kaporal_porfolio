# 3D Text Fonts for Three.js

This folder should contain typeface.json files for use with Text3D in React Three Fiber.

You can download fonts from:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/fonts

Common fonts:
- helvetiker_regular.typeface.json
- helvetiker_bold.typeface.json
- optimer_regular.typeface.json
- gentilis_regular.typeface.json

Note: If you don't have these fonts, the Hero3D component will need to be adjusted to use a different 3D text approach or download the fonts from the Three.js repository.
